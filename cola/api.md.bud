This project provides a C header that enables more feature-rich compilation
across various compilers and platforms. It also contains the basic
documentation for mulle-c development. **mulle-c11** is used by all
*mulle-c* and *mulle-objc* projects.

* [SYNTAX.md](dox/SYNTAX.md) explains the naming scheme used in mulle-c data structure
